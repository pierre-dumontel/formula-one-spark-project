# formula-one-spark-project

## Purpose  
In this repository my main focus is to review and improve my Spark, DataBricks & Azure Solution skills (I already used it since one year from today, November 2022). \ 
For practicing I follow the Azure DataBricks & Spark Core for Data Engineers (https://www.udemy.com/course/azure-databricks-spark-core-for-data-engineers/?src=sac&kw=azure+databricks+%26+spark+co) complemented with Ergast Developer API (http://ergast.com/mrd/) that is basically a formula one database provider. I will also use Google colab notebooks due to Azure licence issues and keep privacy of the course. \

I already have seen theses datasets years ago thanks to Kaggle competitions, so I'm going to use theses inspirations to provide analyses by my own. \

The main purpose of this repo is to documentated for myself what I will from doing this. 


## What I learned and practice thanks to this lessons 

### Knowledge 

-Review and create a Cluster and a Cluster Pool. \
-Review Magic commands (using markdown and access file system) and DataBricks Utilities (such as dbutils). \
-Learning how Mounting Data Lake Container to DataBricks by creating Azure Storage Account and a Blob Storage Container . \
-Learning how creating an Azure Service Principal, Creating Secret Scope and Secret in Key Vault.  
-Connect DataBricks repo to GitHub, create a token, understand how we push notebooks and use versionning. \

### Limitation

I face an issue, due to my Microsfot Azure licence, to use Azure Active directory. So I can't create a Blob Storage usable in DataBricks file system, instead of that I just upload .csv and json files on DataBricks or again use Google Colab.
